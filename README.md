# DiceGamePractice
Working along with the tutorials from foundational training- this dice game was created mainly to practice JS along with HTML/CSS

THE RULES of this game:

1. There are 2 players 
2. In each round, a player rolls a dice as many times as they want to and the rolls get added to the round score
3. If a player rolls a 1, the round score plummets back to a score of 0 and the next player rolls
4. The player can 'hold' and this means the current player's turn stops and the round score gets added to the global total score. Then its the next player's turn
5. A final score is at the bottom of the screen and can be input as whatever the 2 players desire as the global total score- first player to reach this number wins the game
